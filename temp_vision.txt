Myth Busters in Education We fearlessly challenge outdated assumptions, debunk harmful misconceptions, and confront uncomfortable truths about equity, access, technology integration, and educational effectiveness—always grounded in evidence and lived experience.
Who We Serve: Teachers, principals, superintendents, college administrators, workforce development professionals, policymakers, and anyone committed to creating educational systems that work for every student.
Our Promise: Every episode delivers honest, research-informed perspectives that respect educators' expertise while pushing the field forward. We believe the right path isn't always the easiest one—but it's always worth finding together.
