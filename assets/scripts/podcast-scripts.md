## Opening Script

Welcome to The Right Path Podcast, where we explore how artificial intelligence is transforming education, employment, and empowerment. I'm Dr. William Gideon, and I'm here with my cohosts Dr. Marie Martin and Dr. Charles Martin. Together we guide educators, professionals, and lifelong learners through the rapidly evolving landscape of AI. Whether you're a teacher looking to integrate AI into your classroom, a professional navigating career shifts in an automated world, or simply curious about how these technologies are reshaping our future—you've found your path.

Our mission is simple: AI in Action. Educate. Employ. Empower. Each episode, we cut through the hype and noise to bring you practical strategies, real-world case studies, and honest conversations about what AI means for your work, your students, and your career. We believe that understanding AI isn't optional anymore—it's essential. And we're here to make that journey accessible, actionable, and maybe even a little fun. So let's get started.
