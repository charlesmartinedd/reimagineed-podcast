What I need

A full branding guide that meets the highest level of Madison Ave best practices and is fully complete. I want it to have only African Americans and Latinos and for every image or picture it should use Google Nano Banana which we have access to through open router. 

Use ChatGPT VIsion 5 along with a rubric. 

Who We Serve: Teachers, principals, superintendents, college administrators, workforce development professionals, industries, policymakers, and anyone committed to creating educational systems that work for every student.

Name needs to distinctly have Blackness, AI, EDU, and Workforce in title. We should consider being explicit. 

The Right Path will be the landing site where we drive people to learn and research more. We want to show up in the search easily if anyone puts AI Education Black...we want them to know that they don't need to see wht we are...we are it. 

The second podcast had the AIChat EDU, then they drove prospects to learn more at : 21st Century Learning

We need to have AI, EDU, Workforce, and BLACK (A me thing). Vibrainium Central. LOL :) Think it through. 

The Right Path for change should most likely be our tag line which is why the website can be The Right Path or we re sending them to The Right Path for more research, information, courses, and workshops.

Marie, Will, Charles (Phone a friend / announcer to lead folks to website)
🎙️ Podcast Concept 
Positioning:
This podcast is designed for leaders—district superintendents, principals, education innovators, policymakers, and community changemakers—who want an edge in AI and innovation. It’s not “teacher tips” or one-note interviews. It’s a leadership resource for understanding how AI, workforce shifts, and urban/community development intersect with the future of schools.
Identity:
We represent multiple perspectives without being siloed (“teacher vs. leader”).
We model the tensions of innovation—sometimes agreeing, sometimes challenging each other.
We center humanity and equity: how do leaders make AI adoption a tool for removing barriers and creating opportunity?
We draw lines between education, urban development, entrepreneurial thinking, and the future workforce.

Reflection on Existing AI in Education Podcasts
After reviewing a wide range of educational podcasts on AI, including those focused on classroom use, pedagogy, ethics, policy, daily news, district strategy, and teacher roundtable, it is clear that we have a different POV that is missing from the conersation. Of course, most are "Global minority dominant" without any type of POV from minority voices. Given that around 70% of the students we teach are of color within the public school system, we need to have a Podcast that comes from where we are now and where we should be going into the future with technology.

Yes AI (because it is the buzz word), but we need to cover all disruptive technology now and in the future.  While informative, these tend to offer only a single point of view and often lose energy or depth after the initial exchange. Simple interviewing and droning on as in the first podcast from New Zealand, was super boring after about 10-15 minutes. The second podcast on the list was backed and funded well, and had a flow, but I was tired of the two hosts after about 30 minutes. I listened to each all the way through. I feel tht we need to have a blend of us going through current events, etc and then hering from experts who are making change. This will bring tangible steps to where we are, whats the current discourse, explain and even grapple with the information, and then move into having actionable plans for leaders to move forward on the topic.

Our podcast must be distinct: more dynamic, more representative, and deeply aligned with who we are and the communities we serve.
Our Differentiated Approach
Multiple Perspectives
Marie (POV): Ground discussions in how AI impacts classroom practice, instructional design, learning outcomes as well as leadership and organizational change. 
Will (Admin POV): Bring forward district-level strategy, leadership, and policy implications and organizational change.
Executive Producer (EdTech POV - Charles): Act as a "phone-a-friend" voice, chiming in strategically when a tech, safety, or implementation lens is needed, without getting lost in extended banter.
Contrast & Debate
We should not always agree. Disagreement—handled thoughtfully—creates richer dialogue and models the real-world grappling happening in schools. This contrast makes the podcast more authentic and engaging. We need to find our difference of opinion within each session and really try to lay out views from each side (citing of course). I felt that the one with the guy and lady, continually had her agreeing with the guy (he was always acting super goofy so I didn't understand why they agreed on every topic when that's just not the real world). 
Workforce Connection
Dedicate time to exploring how AI is reshaping the broader workforce and what that means for students, teachers, and administrators.
Beyond the Podcast: Extensions
Offer parent workshops and webinars (similar to ChatEDU but centered in community impact).
Provide AI coaching and tool training for educators.
Keep human-centered design at the core—consistently asking how AI can remove barriers for children.
Guest Voices
Each session should feature a special guest, drawing inspiration from the Pod Save America model. Guests can bring in fresh perspectives, from teachers innovating in classrooms to policymakers and tech developers.
Format & Structure
Length: 1 hour episodes.
Breakouts: Produce shorter, bite-sized clips for educators and parents who prefer focused takeaways. (Place on social media and create social network webs)
Headlines Segment: Dedicate time to key AI-in-education current events each session.
Mix of Styles: Blend the best of existing formats—interviews, two-person conversations, expert commentary, and practical takeaways.
